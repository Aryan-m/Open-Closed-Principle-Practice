# Open Closed Principle Practice
 Practice project for OCP (the O in SOLID).
 
 Prompt:
 Create Unit tests for a program where we create a list of attendees and have to print their tickets based on what type of attendee they are. These attendees can have a name field and a ticket price based on whether they are adults, children, etc.
 
 Details:
 The idea is to use an interface "IAttendee" to create a list of attendees. For each attendee type (adult, child, etc) a class that implements the IAttendee interface will be used to print their ticket.
